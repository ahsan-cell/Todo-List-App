## Description

The Todo List App is a learning project developed in Android Studio. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in Android app development while creating a functional and practical application for task management. The app provides a platform for users to create, manage, and organize their tasks efficiently. In addition to basic task management, the app also features editing, deletion, and task completion functionalities.

## Features

- **Add a Todo:** Users can add tasks to their todo list by providing a task description and tapping the "Add" button. This feature taught me about user input handling and data manipulation.

- **Edit Todo:** I implemented an editing feature that allows users to modify task descriptions. This involved working with user interfaces and updating data.

- **Delete Todo:** The delete functionality enabled me to work with user interactions such as swiping and implementing confirmation dialogs before performing critical actions.

- **Check Mark a Todo:** I incorporated checkboxes to mark tasks as completed. This required UI updates and state management.

- **Push Notifications:** One of the key learning points was integrating push notifications. Users can set reminders for their tasks, and I learned about handling background tasks and system notifications.
